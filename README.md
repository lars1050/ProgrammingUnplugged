# ProgrammingUnplugged

Programming Unplugged is a series of assignments designed to build student’s computational skills and acclimate them to rigid syntax. Students read and write simple code to create patterns on a grid with colored tiles – not in simulation, but with real physical elements. In the first assignment, students read code to place tiles (e.g. pink.place(2,3)). The code uses variables whose value is written on a dry-erase card, it makes use of random numbers generated from a die (e.g. x=roll()), random tile selection (e.g. tile=random()) and if-statements based on the value of the roll or the color of the tile. With the sample code, students learn the syntax and see code structure. Once students are comfortable reading code, they choose from a stack of cards of tile pattern images and a stack of cards of relatively simple constraints (e.g. start the pattern at a random position, build the pattern from right to left, or use randomly colored tiles). The cards can be mixed and matched to create several programming problems from a relatively small set. Students share code with their peers to have it tested, giving them practice debugging code. In the second week of Programming Unplugged, the patterns and constraints increase in difficulty requiring more complex logic to solve. Students are introduced to while loops to meet constraints such as “place tiles in a row until the edge of the board is reached” or “place as many tiles as the number rolled.”
